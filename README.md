# JavaConcurrencyProject
This was a project using Java Concurrency in which we had a ladder in which apes wanted to get on the ladder from both sides.
However, if they did both go on at the same time, it would cause them to fall off the ladder.
Therefore, by using monitors and semaphores I was able to only allow one side of apes to go at a time which allowed
no apes to fall down and no deadlock to occur
